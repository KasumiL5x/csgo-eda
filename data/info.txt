NOTE: I have copied this from an older version of the dataset as the author removed most of the detail from the newer one for some reason.

This dataset within the 1000 matches provides every successful entry of duels (or battle) that took place for a player. That is, each row documents an event when a player is hurt by another player (or World e.g fall damage). There are over 750,000 entries within approximately 25600 rounds.

I will describe each field below within mm_master_demos.csv:

file: The file name that the demo was scraped from. This is a unique field for each match.

map: The Valve official map the match was played on.

date: Date the match was played (unverified if they are correct).

round: The round that the duel took place.

tick: The current tick in the demo the entry took place. A tick is represented as a state in the game, Valve's competitive matchmaking sets every match at 64 ticks which represents that there are 64 states within each second of the game.

seconds: The converted tick to seconds within the game since match start.

att_team: The team that the attacking player is on that dealt damage to the victim. Usually Team 1 and 2 but in some recorded pro matches, can have custom team name e.g Games Academy.

vic_team: The team that the victim player is on that received damage from the attacker.

att_side: The side that the attacker was on. Can be Terrorist or CounterTerrorist.

vic_side: The side that the victim was on. Can be Terrorist or CounterTerrorist.

hp_dmg: The total damage dealt in that duel to the victim. Each player starts the round with 100 max hp.

arm_dmg: The total damage dealt to kevlar. Three things to note: 1. Kevlar is an optional item that players choose to buy 2. Kevlar only protects the chest area and 3. Damage to kevlar is already accounted for in hp_dmg, that is if hp_dmg = 50 and arm_dmg = 50, the player has only lost 50 hp and is still alive.

is_bomb_planted: Has the bomb been planted as of this entry.

bomb_site: The site the bomb is planted at (only A or B) and empty if is_bomb_planted is false.

hitbox: The body area the victim was struck in.

wp: The weapon that the attacker used to deal damage.

wp_type: The type of weapon that the attacker used

award: The kill reward (in $) that the player get should they kill that person. The kill reward changes purely based on the weapon they are using.

winner_team: The team that won at the end of that round.

winner_side: The side that the team that winner_team was on.

att_id: The steam id of the attacker. This is a unique identifier for each player.

vic_id: The steam id of the victim. This is a unique identifier for each player.

att_pos_x: The X position of the attacker when they started the engagement. Note that this is an in-game coordinate and need to be converted to positive X,Y coordinates when plotting on a map.

att_pos_y: The Y position of the attacker when they started the engagement. Note that this is an in-game coordinate and need to be converted to positive X,Y coordinates when plotting on a map.

vic_pos_x: The X position of the victim when they received damage. Note that this is an in-game coordinate and need to be converted to positive X,Y coordinates when plotting on a map.

vic_pos_y: The Y position of the attacker when they started the engagement. Note that this is an in-game coordinate and need to be converted to positive X,Y coordinates when plotting on a map.

round_type: The estimated round type by Akiver's csgo demo manager. This is based on ct_eq_val and t_eq_val and is imperfect so there can be mistakes.

ct_eq_val: The Counter Terrorist team's total equipment value (weapon + grenades + armor + utilities) after buy time.

t_eq_val: The Terrorist team's total equipment value (weapon + grenades + armor + utilities) after buy time.
